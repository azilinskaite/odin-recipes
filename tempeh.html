       <li>1 red onion, finely sliced</li>
       <li>3 garlic cloves, roughly chopped</li>
       <li>2cm piece of ginger, peeled and roughly chopped</li>

       <li>200g pouch cooked brown rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a wok or large frying pan over a high heat. Once shimmering, fry the tempeh for 3-4 mins until golden and charred at the edges. Remove from the pan and drain on kitchen paper.</li>
       <li>Add a drizzle of oil to the pan if it's dry, then fry the onion for 3-4 mins, stirring continuously. Once softened, add the garlic, lemongrass (if using), ginger and chilli. Cook for 3 mins, stirring frequently until fragrant.</li>
       <li>Toss through the mange tout and broccoli, then pour 50ml water into the pan to create steam. Cook for 3-4 mins. Add the soy sauce and brown sugar. Return the tempeh to the pan and toss to combine, cooking 2-3 mins more until everything is tender and sticky. Stir in half the coriander.</li>
       <li>Cook the rice following pack instructions, then divide between two bowls. Top with the stir-fry and remaining coriander.</li>
    </ol>
